   - 	Send a letter notifying venues they have legal obligations to provide  access for people with disabilities,
   
   - 	Download a PDF copy of this document,
   
   -	View legal information about your rights to venue access as per current South Australian law, and
   
   - View information about venues' obligations under the disability access laws of *The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (SA)*.
