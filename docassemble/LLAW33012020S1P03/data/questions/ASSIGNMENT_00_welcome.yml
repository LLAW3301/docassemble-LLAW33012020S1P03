  **Welcome to the Equal Opportunity Commission's** 
  **Disability Access Report** (fix wording)
  
    This program has been designed so that you may easily and anonymously
    report your experience of an accessibility issue, directly to the venue
    in question. 


  **This service will assist you to:**
  
   - 	Submit a report to notify venues they have legal obligations to provide  access for disabilities,
   
   - 	Download a PDF copy of this report,
   
   -	View relevant legal information regarding **your** rights to access as per the current law in South Australia, and
   
   - View information detailing the obligations of venues under the disability access laws found in *The Equal Opportunity Act 1984 (SA)*.
