question: Information for Venues (Disability Access)
subquestion: |
  ## This is an unfinished part of the service. Team still editing.
  **This is a brief summary of your obligations as a venue owner/manager.**
 
  To receive a more comprehensive factsheet on the relevant law, download the PDF file attached below. 
  
  [BR]
  **Equal Opportunity Act:**
  
  The Equal Opportunity Act is law that promotes equality of opportunity for all Australian citizens. It prevents discrimination based on *disability*, as well as sex, race, and other grounds with an end goal of promoting citizens’ participation in economic and social life of the community. 
  
  [BR]
  **Obligations of venues to provide access:**
  
  Venues are required by law to provide safe and suitable access onto premises to those with a disability, just as they do with other members of the public. 
  
  It is unlawful for venues providing goods and services to discriminate against another on the ground of disability. This includes:
  
  * Refusing or failing to supply goods and services,
  * Implementing unfair or unreasonable terms and conditions for the entry into the premises or the supply of its goods and services.
  
  In this regard, the owner of the premises **and** the occupier will **each** be obligated to offer or provide indiscriminate services.
  
  [BR]
  **Unjustifiable Hardship Exemption**
  
  While venues must provide safe and suitable access for those with a disability, there may be some circumstances where it is recognised that a venue cannot provide access, due to such changes creating ‘unjustifiable hardship’  for the relevent venue. 
  
  When determining whether taking measures to ensure disability access is reasonably feasible, all relevant circumstances are taken into account, including:
  
  * The nature of the benefit, 
  * The detriment likely to accrue or be suffered by the persons concerned
  * The nature of the disability, and, 
  * Whether it is financial feasible the venue can fulfil this requirement for greater disability access. 

  If would be unreasonable to ask the venue to take steps to ensure the particular access accommodations, the venue may be exempt from making such change.

  [BR]
  *See below for more information regarding methods of improving disability access and for information regarding the formal complaint process.*
