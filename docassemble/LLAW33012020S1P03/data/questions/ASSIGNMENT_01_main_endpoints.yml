question: Disability Access Information for Venues
subquestion: |
  **This is a brief summary of the obligations of venues.**
  
  Venues must provide safe and suitable access to everyone without discrimination, including to those with a disability.  
  
  They must also provide goods and services without discrimination, and cannot implement unfair or unreasonable terms and conditions to the access to or use of goods on the premises. 
  
  However, in circumstances where providing such goods or services constitutes unjustifiable hardship such as incurring unreasonable cost, time and effort versus overall benefits, venues may be given exemption from such an obligation.
  
  [BR]
